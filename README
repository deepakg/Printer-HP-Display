Printer-HP-Display

This module allows you to change the value of the ready message (usually
Ready') on the tiny LCD display that practically all HP laser printers
have. You can also retrieve the value of the currently set message. The
module communicates with the printer using Printer Job Language (PJL).

At the moment this module is just a fun project; somewhat on the lines
of ACME::LOLCAT. For example, at Cricinfo we use it to show cricket
scores on our printer screen (http://twitpic.com/26yt2d). You should be
careful with what you do to the printers at your office - not all IT
managers have a funny bone :-).

Here's how you'd use it in you code:

    use Printer::HP::Display;

    my $printer_ip = "192.168.0.1";
    my $printer = Printer::HP::Display->new($printer_ip);

    my $message = "I am ready. Are you?";

    $printer->set_display($message);

    print $printer->get_display; #currently set message
    print $printer->get_status; #complete dump of PJL INFO STATUS command
